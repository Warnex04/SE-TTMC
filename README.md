# **Space Engineers: Thruster and Cargo Calculator**

A web application to calculate the required number of thrusters for your ship in Space Engineers based on ship weight, cargo, gravity, and ore type. Optimize your ship configurations for various environments and scenarios.

## **Features**

- Calculate thruster requirements based on ship weight and cargo.
- Input cargo amounts for small and large grids.
- Adjustable gravity input for planetary environments.
- Support for specific ore types with density considerations.
- Option to calculate for empty cargo.
- Dynamic sliders for small/large thruster splits.
- Responsive design for all devices.

## **How to Use**

1. Select Grid Type: **Small Grid** or **Large Grid**.
2. Enter Gravity: Specify in `G` (e.g., `1` for Earth gravity).
3. Input Ship Weight: Enter weight in tons.
4. Select Ore Type: Choose ore type or "Empty Cargo."
5. Enter Cargo Amounts: Specify quantities for each tier and type.
6. Adjust Thruster Split: Use sliders to divide thrust between small and large thrusters.
7. View Results: Total mass, required force, and thruster requirements are displayed dynamically.
